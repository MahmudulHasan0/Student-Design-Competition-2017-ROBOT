----------------------------------------------------Some basic stuff to know--------------------------------------------------------
1.) "//" is a symbol that mean its a comment, whatever you write after the "//" on that line, the computer will IGNORE
2.) "/* and */" is a block comment which will make everything inside the "/*" and "*/" a comment:
        example:
        
        x=1
        /* blablalba fknkej kdfjdngjklecjke 
        werhwefhghnhnwehmfxl blablablablaaaaa */  
        y=3
                      
       ^all that stuff is ignored, and computer only read "x=1' and "y=3". we will use he block comment function when
       we need to explain a complex process, this entire file could be placed in block comments
       
WE WILL USE THESE TWO ALOOOOT so that everyone will know why u did what you did (look at the main code i wrote for example)

3.) in Arduino language you MUST put ";" after every command, its to end the line and get to the next line.
    for some stuff like functions, you dont put them.
    
    
For the purposes of these example, i didnt put any ; and i made everything a comment so you can read them

-------------------------------------TWO "MUST HAVE" SECTIONS OF ANY PROGRAMING CODE IN ARDUINO------------------------------

Setup section: "void setup()" function will only run once:
void setup(){
    //this pin will only recieve stuff
    //this pin will only give stuff
    //bla bla bla
    }


Main Code section: "void loop()" basically means "do this over and over" like a loop. Hence the "loop" in "void loop()"
void loop(){
    //if this heppens, do this
    //then do that
    //and that
    }
    
-----------------------------------------MAKING YOUR OWN FUNCTION------------------------------------------------------------------
Once cool thing we can do i make our own fuctions. (each person will have their own function to do)

the function you MADE will be at the very bottom of the code (it will NOT be INSIDE "void loop()")

void climbStairs(){
if i move the controller's stick,
the motors will do this: blablabla
}

-----------------------------------------APPLYING YOUR MADEUP FUNCTION------------------------------------------------------------

void setup(){
//this pin will recieve stuff;
//the motor will do stuff;
}

void loop(){
//if i move the controller stick this way and flick this button, do this:
climbStairs();                                  <--------------ur made up function in the code
}

void climbStairs(){                              <----------------------ur made up function
//if i move the controller's stick,
//the motors will do this: blablabla;
//the motors will do this: blablabla;
//the motors will do this: blablabla;
}
